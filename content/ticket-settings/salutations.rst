Salutations
===========

Addressing customers must be done in a standardized way. Your customers may not always be external customers requiring a less formal greeting.

OTRS provides you with the tools needed to create a standardized communication form for any one of your queues. As defined in the :ref:`Queue Settings`: :doc:`salutations`, :doc:`templates`, and :doc:`signatures` are combined to ensure a well formed standardized email communication.

Salutations can be linked to one or more :doc:`queues`. A salutation is used only in email answers to tickets.

Use this screen to add salutations to the system. A fresh OTRS installation already contains a standard salutation. The salutation management screen is available in the *Salutations* module of the *Ticket Settings* group.

Salutation Variables

Using variables in the text makes it possible to personalize messages. Variables, known as OTRS tags, are replaced by OTRS when generating the message. Find a list of available tags stems for this resource at the bottom of both add and edit screens.

   Salutation Variables

For example, the variable ``<OTRS_CUSTOMER_DATA_UserLastname>`` expands to the customer's last name to be included in something like the following.

.. code-block:: text

   Dear <OTRS_CUSTOMER_DATA_UserFirstname> <OTRS_CUSTOMER_DATA_UserLastname>,

This tag expands, for example to:

.. code-block:: text
