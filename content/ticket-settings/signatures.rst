Signatures
==========

Corporate identity and team information are essential in each communication. The name of the employee writing and other vital details like disclaimers are some examples of necessary information to include in the communication with the customer.

OTRS provides you with the same tools here, as with :doc:`salutations`, to create a standardized communication form for any one of your queues. As defined in the :ref:`Queue Settings`: :doc:`salutations`, :doc:`templates`, and :doc:`signatures` are combined to ensure a well formed standardized email communication.

Signatures can be linked to one or more :doc:`queues`. A signature is used only in email answers to tickets.

Use this screen to add signatures to the system. A fresh OTRS installation already contains a standard signature. The signature management screen is available in the *Signatures* module of the *Ticket Settings* group.

Signature Settings
------------------

The following settings are available when adding or editing this resource. The fields marked with an asterisk are mandatory.

Name \*
   The name of this resource. Any type of characters can be entered to this field including uppercase letters and spaces. The name will be displayed in the overview table.

Signature
   The text that will be placed to the end of new emails.

Validity \*
   Set the validity of this resource. Each resource can be used in OTRS only, if this field is set to *valid*. Setting this field to *invalid* or *invalid-temporarily* will disable the use of the resource.

Comment
   Add additional information to this resource. It is recommended to always fill this field as a description of the resource with a full sentence for better clarity, because the comment will be also displayed in the overview table.


Signature Variables
-------------------

Using variables in the text makes it possible to personalize messages. Variables, known as OTRS tags, are replaced by OTRS when generating the message. Find a list of available tags stems for this resource at the bottom of both add and edit screens.

   Signature Variables

For example, the variable ``<OTRS_CURRENT_UserFirstname> <OTRS_CURRENT_UserLastname>`` expands to the agent's first and last name allowing a template to include something like the following.

.. code-block:: text

   Best regards,

   <OTRS_CURRENT_UserFirstname> <OTRS_CURRENT_UserLastname>

This tag expands, for example to:

.. code-block:: text

   Best regards,
