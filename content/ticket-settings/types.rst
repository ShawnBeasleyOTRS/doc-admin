Types
=====

Good KPIs require knowing the type of work your organization performs. Not all tasks take the same amount of effort even when performed by the same team. Creating a queue structure for this purpose can be overpowered due to the amount of configuration required to create and manage a queue.

OTRS provisions for KPIs with minimal overhead using ticket types. Typical types used in IT service desks are *unclassified*, *incident* and *problem*. You can quickly define new types with ease.

Use this screen to add types to the system. A fresh OTRS installation contains an *unclassified* type by default. The type management screen is available in the *Types* module of the *Ticket Settings* group.
