Dynamic Fields
==============

Beside general information that required for all tickets, organizations have individual needs to add specific details to tickets. This needed information takes various formats like texts, integers, date-time and more.

OTRS supports adding a so-called :term:`dynamic field` to handle texts, integers, drop-down lists, multi-select fields, date-time, checkboxes and more. OTRS administrators can define where those fields should be visible or editable, and of course, the dynamic fields are also available in statistics and reports.

Use this screen to manage dynamic fields in the system. A fresh OTRS installation contains three dynamic fields by default. The dynamic field management screen is available in the *Dynamic Fields* module of the *Processes & Automation* group.

Dynamic Field Settings
----------------------

The following settings are available when adding or editing this resource. The fields marked with an asterisk are mandatory.


General Dynamic Field Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These settings are the same for all types of dynamic fields.

.. figure:: images/dynamic-field-add.png
   :alt: Dynamic Field General Screen

   Dynamic Field General Screen

   The name of this resource. Any type of characters can be entered to this field including uppercase letters and spaces. The name will be displayed in the overview table.

Label \*
   This is the name to be shown on the screens where the field is active.

   .. seealso::

      It is possible to add translations for a dynamic field label. Label translations have to be added manually to language translation files.

   Set the validity of this resource. Each resource can be used in OTRS only, if this field is set to *valid*. Setting this field to *invalid* or *invalid-temporarily* will disable the use of the resource.

Field type
   This type have been selected in the previous page and can not be changed here anymore. This is a read-only field.

Object type
   This type have been selected in the previous page and can not be changed here anymore. This is a read-only field.

   .. note::

      The object type determines where the dynamic field can be used. For example dynamic field with object type *Ticket* can be used only in tickets, and can not be used in articles.

The following settings are relevant only for the particular type of dynamic fields.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This dynamic field allows to add contacts with data to tickets.

.. figure:: images/dynamic-field-contact-with-data.png
   :alt: Contact With Data Dynamic Field Settings

   Contact With Data Dynamic Field Settings

Possible values \*
   These are the possible data attributes for contacts. Clicking on the *⊞* button will add two new fields, where a key (internal value) and a value (displayed value) can be set. With the button you can add multiple key-value pairs.

   .. note::

      The attributes ``Name`` and ``ValidID`` are always mandatory and they are not automatically added, so for each new data source these attributes must be added manually.

      Within the data source definition (or dynamic field configuration) they must be represented by the keys ``Name`` and ``ValidID`` respectively while the values could be *Name* and *Validity* for example.

Mandatory fields
   Comma separated list of mandatory keys.

   .. note::

      Keys ``Name`` and ``ValidID`` are always mandatory and doesn't have to be listed here.

Sorted fields
   Comma separated list of keys in sort order. Keys listed here come first, all remaining fields afterwards and sorted alphabetically.

Searchable fields
   Comma separated list of searchable keys.

   .. note::

      Key ``Name`` is always searchable and doesn't have to be listed here.

Translatable values
   If you activate this option the values will be translated to the user defined language.

   .. note::

      You need to add the translations manually into the language translation files.

Contact with data management
   There is a link *Add/Edit*, that points to *Tickets* → *Edit contacts with data* to add some data.

The usage of this type of dynamic field is more complex then the others. An exemplary usage of contacts with data is as follows:

1. Create a new dynamic field of type contact with data.
2. Set the possible contact attributes (possible values). ``Name`` and ``ValidID`` are required for any contact with data dynamic field.

   - Add ``Name`` attribute (key: ``Name``, value: *Name*).
   - Add ``ValidID`` attribute (key: ``ValidID``, value: *Validity*).
   - Add any other attribute such as ``Telephone`` attribute (key: ``Telephone``, value: *Phone*).

3. Add the list of mandatory attribute keys comma separated (``Name`` and ``ValidID`` are not needed).
4. Set the attribute key order list comma separated as: ``Name,Telephone,ValidID``.
5. Add the list of searchable attribute keys comma separated (``Name`` is not needed).
6. Populate the data source by adding at least one contact in the newly created data source by using *Tickets* → *Edit contacts with data* screen from the main navigation bar.
7. Add the new dynamic field to the screen's configuration where it should be shown. For example in *New Phone Ticket* screen by updating the system configuration setting ``Ticket::Frontend::AgentTicketPhone###DynamicField`` and do the same for ``Ticket::Frontend::AgentTicketZoom###DynamicField``.
8. Go to *New Phone Ticket* screen, and notice that the new field is there. Add all needed information to the ticket.
9. Select an existing contact using autocomplete and choosing a contact.
10. The assigned contact and its attributes will be shown in the *Ticket Zoom* screen.
11. It is possible to update the attributes of the contact by clicking the *Edit contact data* button that appears in the right side of the title of the contact data box (if the current user is a member of the groups defined in system configuration setting ``Frontend::Module###AdminDynamicFieldContactWithData``).
12. If is necessary to change the contact for this ticket, it can be done via any other ticket action where the dynamic field is configured for display.

   It is possible to add multiple dynamic fields at the same time. To do this, repeat steps 5-7.


Set Default Value via Ticket Event Module
-----------------------------------------

A ticket event (e.g. ``TicketCreate``) can trigger a value set for a certain field, if the field does not have a value yet.

1. Open the *System Configuration* module in the admin interface.
2. Navigate to *Core* → *Event* → *Ticket* and search for the setting ``Ticket::EventModulePost###9600-TicketDynamicFieldDefault``.
3. Click on the *Edit this setting* button to activate the setting.
4. Click on the tick button on the right to save the setting.
5. Deploy the modified system configuration.

.. figure:: images/dynamic-field-ticket-event-module.png
   :alt: Activate Ticket Event Module

   Activate Ticket Event Module

Example: activate *Field1* in ``TicketCreate`` event:

1. Open the *System Configuration* module in the admin interface.
2. Navigate to *Core* → *Ticket* → *DynamicFieldDefault* and search for the setting ``Ticket::TicketDynamicFieldDefault###Element1``.
3. Click on the *Edit this setting* button to activate the setting.
4. Click on the tick button on the right to save the setting.
5. Deploy the modified system configuration.

.. figure:: images/dynamic-field-ticket-dynamic-field-default.png
   :alt: Activate Dynamic Field in Ticket Create Event

   Activate Dynamic Field in Ticket Create Event

.. note::

   This configuration can be set in any of the 16 ``Ticket::TicketDynamicFieldDefault###Element`` settings.

.. seealso::
   If more than 16 fields needs to be set up, a custom XML file must be placed in ``$OTRS_HOME/Kernel/Config/Files/XML`` directory to extend this feature.


Set Default Value via User Preferences
--------------------------------------

The dynamic field default value can be overwritten with a user defined value stored in the personal preferences.

   :alt: Dynamic Field in Personal Preferences

   Dynamic Field in Personal Preferences

This setting is an example of how to create an entry in the user preferences screen to set an exclusive dynamic field ``Name_X`` default value for the selected user. The limitation of this setting is that it only permits the use of one dynamic field. If two or more fields will use this feature, it is necessary to create a custom XML configuration file to add more settings similar to this one.

.. note::

   If more settings are added in a new XML each setting name needs to be unique in the system and different than ``PreferencesGroups###DynamicField``. For example:

   - ``PreferencesGroups###101-DynamicField-Field1``
   - ``PreferencesGroups###102-DynamicField-Field2``
   - ``PreferencesGroups###My-Field1``
   - ``PreferencesGroups###My-Field2``
