Web Services
============

In a connected world, a ticket system needs to be able to react to requests from other systems and also to send requests or information to other systems:

* CRM systems
* Project management systems
* Documentation management systems
* and many more

The ticket system must be reachable by other services without manual intervention by an agent.

OTRS supports this requirement by the *Generic Interface*. It empowers the administrator to create a web service for a specific task without scripting language knowledge. OTRS reacts on incoming REST or SOAP requests and create objects or provides object data to other systems transparently.

A web service is a communication method between two systems, in our case OTRS and a remote system. In its configuration, the :term:`operation` or :term:`invoker` determine the direction of communication, and the :term:`mapping` and :term:`transport` take care of how the data is received and interpreted.

In its configuration it can be defined what actions the web service can perform internally (operation), what actions the OTRS request can perform remote system (invokers), how data is converted from one system to the other (mapping), and over which protocol the communication will take place (transport).

The generic interface is the framework that makes it possible to create web services for OTRS in a predefined way, using already made building blocks that are independent from each other and interchangeable.

Use this screen to manage web services in the system. A fresh OTRS installation contains no web service by default. The web service management screen is available in the *Web Services* module of the *Processes & Automation* group.

Debug threshold
   The default value is *Debug*. When configured in this manner all communication logs are registered in the database. Each subsequent debug threshold value is more restrictive and discards communication logs of lower order than the one set in the system.

   Debug threshold levels (from lower to upper):

   - Debug
   - Info
   - Notice
   - Error

Validity
   Set the validity of this resource. Each resource can be used in OTRS only, if this field is set to *valid*. Setting this field to *invalid* or *invalid-temporarily* will disable the use of the resource.
