S/MIME Certificates
===================

Faculty and staff have key roles safeguarding critical information by implementing information security policies, standards, and controls. Safe email communication is a vital part of protecting this communication.

OTRS empowers you to encrypt communications where needed by means of :doc:`s-mime-certificates` or :doc:`pgp-keys`.

.. note::

   Setup of services and software required for encryption are not covered here because of independence to this software.

Use this screen to add S/MIME certificates to the system. The S/MIME management screen is available in the *S/MIME Certificates* module of the *Communication & Notifications* group.
