Email Addresses
===============

The main channel of communication with the customers is often email. An organization consists of multiple department or teams. Email addresses differ for each group which is servicing your customer. You may have the following:

| ``support@example.org``
| ``hr@exapmle.org``
| ``sales@example.org``

These addresses are just some examples, and you may have many more. You use these channels to receive and send messages, and in mail clients, one can often send with the wrong address.

OTRS manages as many email addresses for your teams as needed. All your email addresses, whether for sending or receiving, are kept and configured nicely in one place. In the :ref:`queue settings`, the correct address is always chosen preventing that someone working in multiple roles sends an email out with the wrong account.

To enable OTRS to send emails, you need a valid email address to be used by the system. OTRS is capable of working with multiple email addresses, since many support installations need to use more than one. A queue can be linked to many email addresses, and vice versa. The address used for outgoing messages from a queue can be set when the queue is created.

Use this screen to add system email addresses to the system. An email address is already added to the system at installation time of OTRS. The email address management screen is available in the *Email Addresses* module of the *Communication & Notifications* group.

.. warning::

   Email addresses can not be deleted from the system. They can only be deactivated by setting the *Validity* option to *invalid* or *invalid-temporarily*.

.. note::

   Once an email address is added and set to valid, OTRS cannot send an email to this address. This prevents loopbacks which could crash your system. If you need to transfer information between departments please use the ticket split option in the article menu. This will allow you to create a new ticket to another team for assigning a task, for example.
