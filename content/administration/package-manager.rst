Package Manager
===============

Modular systems can be extended by adding additional software packages to the framework. Administrators need an easy way to see which features are installed in which version and for sure to add, update and remove packages.

OTRS uses a package manager to perform all package-related activities as mentioned above in the graphical interface.

.. note::

   This module is only available when using *On-Pemise* or the *((OTRS)) Community Edition*. To see a list of installed modules, you may also see the :doc:`../otrs-group-services/support-data-collector`.

Use this screen to install and manage packages that extend the functionality of OTRS. The package manager screen is available in the *Package Manager* module of the *Administration* group.
