Chat Channels
=============

Being able to offer chat possibilities to customers is a must-have for many organizations. Depending on the amount of customer chat requests and the organization's structure, it must be possible to group chat requests.

OTRS offers chat channels with different permissions per channel, so it is, e.g. possible to have different chat channels for registered contract customers and public prospects.

Use this screen to add chat channels to the system. A fresh OTRS installation contains no chat channels by default. The chat channel management screen is available in the *Chat Channels* module of the *Administration* group.
