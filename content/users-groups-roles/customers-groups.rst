Customers ↔ Groups
==================

Your organization grows, and it's not practical at some point to assign permissions to individual users, you need to assign the permissions to all customer users of a customer.

OTRS allows you to assign :term:`group` permissions to a :term:`customer`. Access works just the same as for agents, preventing a customer from modifying and viewing a request. Thus allowing the customer to focus on the results of the original communication and funneling the discussion through one ticket.

.. seealso::

   Assign a single customer user to a group using :doc:`customer-users-groups`.

Use this screen to add one or more customers to one or more groups. To use this function, at least one customer and one group need to have been added to the system. The management screen is available in the *Customers ↔ Groups* module of the *Users, Groups & Roles* group.

Customer group support needs to be enabled in at least one customer user :term:`back end` to use this function. For the default OTRS :term:`back end`, this can be enabled in the system configuration by clicking on the *Enable it here!* button.

.. note::

   To enable this feature in systems using a directory server or multiple non-default back ends, a custom configuration file needs to be placed in ``Kernel/Config/Files`` (for example named ``ZZZ_CustomerBackend.pm``). Once activated, all customer users from this back end will require group assignment.

.. warning::

   After making changes to the back end, the server cache will be deleted, which may cause a temporary drop in performance.

These groups are automatically assigned to all customers.

.. note::

   If several customers or groups are added to the system, use the search box to find a particular customer or use the filter box to find a particular group by just typing the name to filter.

Multiple customers or groups can be assigned in both screens at the same time. Additionally clicking on a customer or clicking on a group in the relations will open the *Edit Customer* screen or the *Edit Group* screen accordingly.

.. warning::

   Accessing a customer or a group provides no back link to the relations screen.


Customers ↔ Groups Relations Reference
--------------------------------------

When assigning a customer to a group or vice versa, several permissions can be set as connection between a customer and a group. The following permissions are available by default:

Same Customer
   Gives customer users group based access to tickets from customer users of the same customer (ticket ``CustomerID`` is a ``CustomerID`` of the customer user).

ro
   Read only access to the resource.

rw
   Full read and write access to the resource.

.. note::

   By setting a checkbox in the header of a column will set all the checkboxes in the selected column.
