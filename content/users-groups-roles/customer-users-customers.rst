Customer Users ↔ Customers
==========================

In an organization, for example, which views its customers as it's departments and teams, a customer user may have to have access to multiple customers tickets for controlling purposes. Maybe you have partners who represent several different companies, or a corporation wants to have a look at all the requests of their subsidiaries.

For all situations, OTRS provides the means. Aside from a primary customer, your customer users can gain access to multiple customer tickets as defined by you.

Use this screen to add one or more customer users to one or more customers. To use this function, at least one customer user and one customer need to have been added to the system. The management screen is available in the *Customer Users ↔ Customers* module of the *Users, Groups & Roles* group.

.. note::

   If several customer users or customers are added to the system, use the search box to find a particular customer user or customer. Only the first 1000 customer users and customers are listed by default.

Multiple customer users or customers can be assigned in both screens at the same time. Additionally clicking on a customer user or clicking on a customer in the relations screen will open the *Edit Customer User* screen or the *Edit Customer* screen accordingly.

.. warning::

   Accessing a customer user or a customer provides no back link to the relations screen.

.. note::
