Groups
======

Group Settings
--------------

The following settings are available when adding or editing this resource. The fields marked with an asterisk are mandatory.

Name \*
   The name of this resource. Any type of characters can be entered to this field including uppercase letters and spaces. The name will be displayed in the overview table.

   .. note::

      Renaming a group does not affect permissions previously given. When *group1* is now called *group2*, then all the permissions are the same for the users which used to be assigned to *group1*. This result is because OTRS uses IDs for the relationship, and not the name.

Validity \*
   Set the validity of this resource. Each resource can be used in OTRS only, if this field is set to *valid*. Setting this field to *invalid* or *invalid-temporarily* will disable the use of the resource.

   .. note::

      Invalidating a group does not remove the permissions from the user, but only makes them invalid. If you reactivate this group, even with a new name, the permissions take effect.

Comment
   Add additional information to this resource. It is recommended to always fill this field as a description of the resource with a full sentence for better clarity, because the comment will be also displayed in the overview table.


Default Groups
--------------

Every agent's account should belong to at least one group or role. In a fresh installation, there are some pre-defined groups available:

``admin``
   Allowed to perform administrative tasks in the system.

``stats``
   Qualified to access the stats module of OTRS and generate statistics.

``users``
   Agents should belong to this group, with read and write permissions. They can then access all functions of the ticket system.
