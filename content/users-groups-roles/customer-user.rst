Customer User
=============

A record of who your company deals with requires more information about that individual: Physical location, for shipping and billing purposes, as well as contact information for email and phone contact.

OTRS offers a great way to save individual information about contacts within organizations which your company serves. You can add as many personal connections into OTRS as needed.

Use this screen to add a :term:`customer user` to the system. A fresh OTRS installation contains no customer users by default. The customer user management screen is available in the *Customer User* module of the *Users, Groups & Roles* group.

2. Click on the magnifying glass icon in the right part of the field or hit an ``Enter``.

   If several customer users are added to the system, use the search box to find a particular customer user. Only the first 1000 customer users are listed by default.
